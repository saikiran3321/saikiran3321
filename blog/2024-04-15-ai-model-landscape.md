## The Evolution of AI Models

The journey from simple linear regression to sophisticated transformer architectures represents decades of research and innovation. Today's AI landscape encompasses everything from lightweight models that run on mobile devices to massive foundation models requiring data center-scale infrastructure.

### Traditional Machine Learning Era

The foundation of modern AI was built on classical machine learning algorithms:

- **Linear Models**: Simple yet effective for many prediction tasks
- **Tree-Based Methods**: Interpretable models like Random Forest and XGBoost
- **Support Vector Machines**: Powerful for classification with clear margins
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Unsupervised learning for pattern discovery

These models remain relevant today, especially in scenarios requiring interpretability, limited data, or constrained computational resources.

### The Deep Learning Revolution

The introduction of deep neural networks transformed AI capabilities:

```python
# Evolution from simple to complex architectures
# Traditional: Linear Regression
y = w1*x1 + w2*x2 + b

# Deep Learning: Multi-layer Neural Network
def deep_network(x):
    h1 = relu(W1 @ x + b1)
    h2 = relu(W2 @ h1 + b2)
    h3 = relu(W3 @ h2 + b3)
    return softmax(W4 @ h3 + b4)
```
